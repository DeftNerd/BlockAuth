The Legal Requirements

Anytime digital currency is exchanged for fiat currency (USD, Euro, etc), regulations in many countries and jurisdictions require that those exchangers follow several rules. 

The first one, Know Your Customer (KYC) refers to the due diligence financial institutions are required to perform on their customers as an aspect of doing business. In order to comply with federal regulations surrounding financial fraud, money laundering, identity theft, and terror financing, Bitcoin companies that convert digital currencies to some other kind of asset (such as physical cash) are required to verify their customers by instituting policies on customer acceptance and transactions.

The other rule that's important is FinCen's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. 
AML compliance requires companies to monitor and report any suspicious activity or transactions over $2000 if they are relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation. Companies also have to keep records of the transactions, including the amount, date and time, account information, IP address, etc. Also, similar regulations require reporting any accounts that transact over 10k a day, as well as preventing transactions coming from any countries that the US has sanctions against (Burma, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria). 

This kind of compliance causes a lot of problems for small startups. First of all, it causes customer friction. Customers don't like to have to input all this information, especially over and over with different sites. It also requires startups to spend a lot of time and resources engineering safe ways to process and store this information. It's also expensive because it often requires them to hire a full-time employee to verify the information. Another danger is that if a startup makes a mistake in how they store this information and the site is breached, it's often the end of that company since they'll lose customer loyalty as well as have to pay for expensive credit monitoring for all of their customers. 

Overview of range of services
The answer is BlockAuth. BlockAuth is a service that allows people to outsource their KYC & AML requirements to, as well as a service that protects the privacy of the end users and provides a convenient accounting system for them. 

Our primary service offering is that we'll function as an OAUTH provider. All member sites have to do add a little snippet on their website and users can log in with BlockAuth just like how some sites let people login with their Google Account or Facebook Connect. 

At a minimum, the member site will always get a user identifier that will always be unique for the relationship between that user and that site (sites can use this as the user identifier), and the Auth Score the user has. Other information can be requested such as the users phone number, the complete or portions of the mailing address, email address, profile photo, links to social media, etc. The user ultimately has the choice to allow or disallow that information to be passed to the member site. 

In order to build up their Auth Score, end users will go to our site to fill out their information. We perform KYC checks on everything and provide encouragement to the users to verify more and more to increase their Auth Score. 

Some member sites will require a minimum Auth Score to use their services, such as an online merchant might require users to have a verified phone number and postal address. A loan provider might require that the end user have a verified source of income, address, and drivers license scanned. A travel agency might require the end user to have a scanned passport page. BlockAuth will tell the member sites if the end user has those things verified. 


How to make money
To further protect the end users privacy, we will provide the service of tumbling bitcoin transactions. In essence, we can receive and forward all payments between end users the member sites. For this service, we will take a 0.0001 BTC fee for every transaction. 

We will also allow users to send and receive dozens of alternate currencies and for an small fee, convert it to bitcoins for our users. 

We can also act as an intermediary for other sites that require other identification. If a site insists on an email address, we can supply an email address for the user that will forward on the message to the user. We can do the same for phone numbers. If a site demands a working phone number, we can supply one that, when called or txt'd, will reach the user. 

The last option on income is charging a fee anytime someone requests a users records (law enforcement, legal proceedings, a member site, etc).
